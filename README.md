## Dataset

The Olivetti Faces dataset contains 400 grayscale images of faces, each measuring 64x64 pixels. Each image is associated with a label representing the individual depicted in the image. The dataset is used to evaluate machine learning algorithms for face recognition tasks.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
